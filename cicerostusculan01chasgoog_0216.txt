“ Thou, as a galluni burk from Albion's coast
(The storms all weatherpd and tire ocean crossed)
Shoots into port at som well-harem isle,
whom spioes brostin md brigirtermsont smila,
Thena sits quiescent on tho floods, that show
Her beautrous form reflectet clear below,
While aits impregnaoed with incense play
Around her, sanning light her smamers gay,
So thou, with sails how swistl hast reached tlte shore
‘Where tempests never beat nor billows roar’3
And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide
Ol lise, long since, has anchored at thy side.
But me, soarce hoping to attain that rest,
Always from port withheld, always distressed, -·
Me howling winds drivo (levinus, tempesttost,
Salis ripped, seams opening wide, and compass lost ;
And day by day some current's thwarting force
Sets me more distant from a prosperous course.”

either restricts the idea to which it is added, or marks out a
thing pmminently, and thus either strengthens the sentiment
or adds force to the expression (like the German eben),
receives again agrester demonstrative power by the prefixing
tf the vowel e. Thus is formed a particle adapted to con·
firm the sentiment in various ways. But that demonstrative
power which is inherent in the particle was particularly em-
ployed by ancient usage in such a manner, that by it the
speaker marked with a certain affirmative force those things
¹ which he avowed concerning himself and his own opinion, or
in regard to his own affairs. Hence it happened that equidem
was joined, as a general rule, with the first person of the
verb. The Latine, then, had an appropriate word by which
the speaker might turn the attention of his hearers to his
own subject or his own opinion, and add weight to his deo-

laration in regardtohimself. When this had become estab- ¹

lished by nse, the vulgar opinion hit upon the explanation,
that the word had been compounded of epo and quidem ,· and
to this notion, adopted even in antiqnity by the grammarians,
certain writers accommodated their language.”

ιαπὶ The reading I give was suggested by Bentley, end
has been adopted by Daris, Tregder, and Tischer. The
change of deciorum into dechrrot obviates all difficulties of
construction and interpretation, and is justified by the fact tn
which Tischer alludet, that in the Regius MS. the ungulas·
and plural are olten consouuded. Moser gres the same
reading, but brackets the whole sentence Declarot . . . . sere-
teotio, as the gloss of some skilful hand. Several editors
enclose the words between norm and urse autem aomos in
brackets3 others mark in the ame manner the words et oni-
mosos et h. a. et eo o. sententio. Orelli’s remark on this point,
however, isbosed on a round principle of textual criticism:
‘⁴ Praestat umen in illis et animos, cet, λογικὸν ἁμάρτημα Gi·
ceronis ipsius agnoscere, quam glossema⁸⁹ Moser himself sue·
eessi'ully vindicatas the Ciceronian purity of the words which
he brackets. The sentiment of the whole passage, as Kiihner
remarks, is this: There heve been philosophers who said that
the mind was nothing but air, and this opinion seems to be

Ι confirmed by the Latin language‚ which has many words und

phrases in which the word anione has the sams signification
as anemos.
Ipse autem animm Some editors, thinking that the words

between nornen and inae should be omitted, read tyrse enen η

eruimus, -a reading which is not supported by the MSS.
Zenoni. Zeno, the founder ot the Stoic philosophy.
Zenoni . .. . animus ignia videtin. “Ignis intelligitur πνεῦ-

μαένθερμον. Diog. L.vii.157.” Kir'hner. Zeno regarded

individual souls as being what the eoul of the universe was ς ¹
as of the uenire of tire, or as roone lireoth ,· and therefore ¹

as perishable. Smith’s Dict. of Buff. ond Mythol. Fire
was very naturally regarded by tho ancients as the symbol οἰ
all immuterial forces.

X. Vulgo: scil. animum statuunt esse. Reliqua sere ein· =

puli: scil. dicunt. Th0 idea is: The opinions I have thus
far stated conceming the nature of the mind have been com-
monly accepted, those lam now about to state have been
advauced almost by single individuale.

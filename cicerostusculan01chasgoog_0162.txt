Dii Manes were relipiosoe; those consecrated to the Dii
Superi were called samaa. Eveu the place in which a slave
was buried was considered as religione. Whoever violated
a sepulchre was subject to an action termed sepulcri violati
actio. These who removed the bodies or bones from the
sepulchre w'ere punished by death or deportatio in insulam,
according to their rank, if the sepulchre was violated in any
other way, they were punished by deportatio, or condemnatiou

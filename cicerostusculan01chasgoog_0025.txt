ister consolation to friends in distreus - bnt only such conso
lation es 'theyoruld be made to receive. lt is known that he
was iu several of these mancas writing to Epicuream, who,
disbeliewing the immortality of the nul, could derivo no oom-
iort from the presentation os that doctrine In other passages,
perhaps this argument would fail us; but, to adopt the words
of Middletnn, “we must remember always that Cicero was an
Academio; and though he believed afuturo state, was fond
of the opinion, and declares himself resolved never to part
with it, yet he believed it es probable only, not as certain3
and as probability implies nme mixture of doubt and admits
the degrees of more and less, so it admits also seme variety
in the stability of our persuasione: thus, in a melancholy
honr, when his spirits were depressed, the same argument
would not appear to him with the same force, but doubts and
difficulties get the ascendant, and what humored his present
chagrin find the readiest admission. . . . . But aller all, what-
ever be the sense of these letters, it cannot surely be thought
reasonable to oppose afew scattered hints, accidentally thruwn
out, when he was not considering the subject, to the volumes

that he had deliberately written on the other side os tbe

Upon the whole, while it cannot be denied that Cicero had
not that deep and firmly established conviction of the fact of a
future state which we entertain at the present day, there
seems to be no sufficient reason to doubt that he felt a strong
persuasion of its probability, which almost amounted to belief.
The arguments cf Socrates, of Plato, and of the Pythagoreans
in favor of immortality found a response in the depths of his
heart, and the voice of the diviuity within him at times
attested to his soul the truth of this doctrine with a power
far transcending the cold deductione cf reasoning. He may
not have appreciated the value cf this inward revelation3 he
may have faltered and doubted when he attempted to state
according to a formal, artificial system the grounds of h'm

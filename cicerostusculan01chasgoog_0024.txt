which the contrary supposition is for a moment adopted in
the De Senectute, only increases the appearance of sincerity
with which the doctrine of immortality is defended in that
dialogue. “lt”lsays Catu, “as certain peltry philosophers
suppose-quidam minuti philosophi,--I shall feel nothing
when I am dead, I have no sear that these philosophers will
langh at my delusion when they and I shall be no more.”
And in neither of these dialogues can the supposition, for the
sake oi the argument, that the contraryis true, be taken as
an indicationes doubt in Cicero’s mind, any more than the
words of many Christian writers, who, alter vindicating the
claims of their saith to universal acceptante, have added,
“Even if this religion be all a fable and an imposition, no
herm, but rather incalculable benefit, would result fiem its
adoptiun.” The confidente with which a belief in a future
lile is asserted in these two treatises, “designed to be gener-
ally intelligible rather than philosophically accurate,” and thus
leaving their writer eomparatirely unshackled by his sceptical
system, should be allowed great weight, as Ritter suggests,
in proof of the reality of his convicti0n3 while his seeming
to leave the question undecided in the Tusculan Disputations
can be easily explained by the restrictione of his philosophy,
in the seme manner as he himself accounts for the fact that
Socrates-who, as Ritter, Grote, and authorities generally
agree, undoubtedly believed in the existence of the soul alter
death - pretended, in his Apology, to consider the point as
undetermined, ‘⁶ etsi, quod praeter deos negat scire quem-
quam, id scit'ipse ..... nam dixit ante; sed suum illud, nihil
ut affirmet, tenet ad extremum” Tusc- Dap Ι. xlii. 99'.

But perhaps the mest serious difficulty is presented in sever-
al expressions in Cicero’s letters to his friends, which seem to
implya doubt of the existence of a future state. Here, again,
we should inquire, What was Cicero’s purpose in writing
these letters? In some of them it was, doubtless, to admin-

ztan (Andronicus). The earliest Roman author, as far
as poetical literature is concerned.

Ennius. The father of Roman epic poetry, and distin-
guished also as a dramatist; born 239 n. c.

Plautus. The most celebrated comic poet of Rome, born
about 254 n. c, died 184.

Naevius. A Roman epic and dramatic poet, born probably
between 274 and 26413. c.

Qui suit major natu qstam Plautus et Naevius. This pas·
regebas given commentators no little difficulty. Theposi-
tion of qui would seem to make it necessary that it should be
referred to Ennius as its antecedent3 but the factis, that
Ennius was not older than Plautus and Naevius, but younger
than either. If, then, we retain the reading qui fuit . . ..
Naevius, we must either suppose, with Davis, that Cicero has
made here a σφάλμα μνημονικόν, or we must, like Orelli,
Klotz, and Moser, refer the relative to Livius as its antecedent.
The explanation given by Davis-that Cicero in this pas·
sage made a mistahe in regard to his facts—is rightly re-
jected by most scholars as altogether improbable, particularly
since, in his Brutus, xviii, he points out and censures the
same mistake in the annalist Accius which is here charged
upon himself. The other alternative-to refer the quito
Livius,.-'-is rejected by Kiihner, because, in the first place,
he says, such is the nature of the relative pronoun that it
ought to be referred to the noun next preceding, and, in the
second place, an addition such as is contained in the clause
qui fuit . .. . Naevius is feeble and inappropriate, especially ιιι
this place, where there is no discussion about the ratio tcm-
porum, buta mere passing allusion is made to the age of
Livius. He thinks, therefore, that the passage was first writ
ten on the margin of a MS. by some commentator, to defins
more precisely the age of Livius, and that it afterwards crept
into the text; and he encloses these words in brackets in his
edition. Some other eminent editors take the same view of
the subject; and accordingly Wolf omits altogether the words

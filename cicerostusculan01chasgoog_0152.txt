Ut poscit judicari: So nat ir can bc judyed. ‘⁴ It may be
observed of the particle ut (uti), that it basile root in the
same interrogative and relative pronominal theme from which '

uter, ubi, &c are derived, and therefore originally significs
how, or (relatively) os. From low is deduccd the significa-
tion that, as applied‘to express a purpose and the object of
the verb, and from the relative usage partly the signification
cs scon cs (ct veni, obiit), partly that of eo that (just aethe
pronoun qui acquires the signification of so tltut lae). Then
the original signification ie still further lost, so that the word
only marks out a proposition indefinitely and generally as the
object or complement of another (with verbe of happening).”

Dictionary than complete descriptione 3 they are derived
chiefly from Smith's Dictionaries, and various editions
of the Tusculan Disputations. Frequent reference has
, been made to Zumpt’a Grammar,-a work containing
the gernered treasures of a lifetime of enthusiaatic de·
votion to classica] studies,-to the admirable treatisa
on Latin Syntax by Dr. Beck, - and to the Grammar
of Andrews and Stoddard3 and the recent publication
of an excellent American translation has authorized
occasionn] references to tha Lexicon of Freund.

The high character of many of the editions of Greek
and Roman authors which have lately appeared from
the American presa, indicates the rapid progress oi
classical scholarship in this country in the last few
years· The light recent philological investigatione have
shed upon the history, structure, and significance of the
ancient languages‚ and thus upon tha science of lan·
guage itself, - language, which ia at once the great
instrument of thought and the noblest product of mind,
-adds a new digniiy and velue to even the most ele-
mentary processea in classica] instruction. We must
ever be indebted to the Old World for the thoroughness
and ability with which her philologists have parsued
these investigations3 but American scholare can share
in the fruita of their labora, weigh aad combine their
decisione with an independent judgment, and perform
a useful, though comparatively humhle service, in ap·
plying them to increase the value and efficiency of
classica] studies as a means of mental training. The
editor will be gratitied if thia book shall help, even in

the slighteat degree, in thus advancing the interests of
acund learning.

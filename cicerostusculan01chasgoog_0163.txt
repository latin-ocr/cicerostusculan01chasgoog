referred to vitae es its antecedent liiihner explains the
passage thus: Vita e virtutis praeceptis acta dicitur esee dux
in coeluum vita hominum sitiisse voluptatibus deditorum
dicitur humi retineri et permanere nmen, h. evita ejusmodi
hominum etiam postmortem in his terris continuatur,—quia
eorum animi, terrestria amplexati, in caelum evolare non poe
sunt, sed circum terram volutantur,-ita tamem ut ea nou
ultera morto exstinguatur, sed permaneat.

lt cannot be denied that the construction with our maffing
isbarsh. Some old editors read retineret ; some MSS. reti-
neret et permanerent tamen. Lambinus, in his ed. of 1566,
t'n cetenensium retineret, at permanerent mmen. One MS.

to rise, after death, to the abodes os pure spirits, linger

eround their old bodies, or become joined to new end inferior =

Souls of this character, says Plato (Phaedo, 69, 70, Cary’s l

trans), “impressed with that which iscorporeal, which the

intercourse and communion of the body, through constant as- ι

sociation and great attention, have made natural to them, . .. .

by possessing which [thoy] are weighed down, and drawn 3

again into the visible world through dread of the invisible
and of Endos-wanden, it is said, amongst monuments and

tombs; about which, indeed, certain shadowy phantoms of ³

sauls have been seen, being such images as those souls pro-

duced which have not departed pure from the body, but which ,

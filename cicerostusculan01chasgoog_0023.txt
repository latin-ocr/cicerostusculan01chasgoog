In regard to the second point, iu none of the treatises in
which Cicero alludes to the immortality of the soul, unless we
except the Somnium Scipionis, was it his immediate object to
assert the truth os that doctrine. In that beautiful Vision this
· truth is maintained with a directness that admits of no ques·
tion, Cicero’s aim being to show that vvise and virtuous states·
men are rewarded, not only by the cousciousness' of good
deeds, but also bya participation in the immortal glories oi

upon this question in the author’s mind, the same ansvver can
be given, — that the admission of this truth vas not essentia]
to the defence of the proposition to be established. Cato
could still maintain that the fear of dissolution ought not to
embitter our declining years, and Laelius that it had gone

VII. Immo: On tte contrary. This word, allied with the
superlative imus, means literally oa the under side, on tte
ott'er eide, oa the reversa-e contracto.. It hence ac
quires its meaning, in answers conveying a correction, of “ no,
on the other hand,” “no indeed,” “ much rather.” Some
grammarians have considered itas sometimes an affirncatioc
particle, to be translated by ‘⁴ ye's indeed,'’ “by all means ”;

but in all the passages where such a meaning hes been as· ἶ

signed it, its primary corrective force can be easily distin-
guished. The answer may convey an assent to the propo-
sitien of the preceding speaker, but immo always, iu such
cases, introduces some 'stroayer expression, and thus, even
then, denies the weaker expression which precedes. “This

increase,'' says Zumpt (Gr. ξ 277), ‘⁶ may be sometimes ex· ,

pressed in English by ‘aaa’ or ‘noy coen! But this does
not justify the assertion that immo is an affirmative adverb.'’
In¹ consequence of the derivation of this word, some gramma-

· rians prefer the orthography imo, which is adopted by Moser. ’

But the adjective itself was sometimes written immus; and
the weight of authority is decidedly in favor of immo.

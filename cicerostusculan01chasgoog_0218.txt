ΤΗΕ DREAM OF sumo,

Tun Somnium Scipionis is introduced as an episode in the
nixth and last book of the admirable treatise De Rc Publica,
written a. e. 54, and one of the earliest of Cieero's philosophi· -
eal worhs. The sorm of this meatise is that of a dialogue‚ the
interlocutars being Scipio Africanus Minor, his nephew Q
AElius Tubero, and his friends O. Laelius the Wise, L. Furius
Philus, M'. Manilius, Sp. Mummius, P. Rutilius Rufus, Q.
Mucius Seaevola, and 0. Fannius. The soene of the conver·
sation is laid in a sunny lawn in the gaudens of Scipio, during
the Latin holidays, n. e. 129. (De Rep. L ix. -xii.)

The first extract in the Introduction (p. 69) isfrom the
Commentary on lle Somnium Scipiones of Favonius Eulogius,
a rhetorician of Carthage, and a contemporary and pupil οῖ’
St Augustine. The entire Commentary will be found in
Graevius’s edition of Cicero de Officiis, pp. 438-,447 (Am-
sterdam, 1688). The impure Latinity of the period in which ¹
it was oomposed will be noticed in this extract

Eris Pamphyli. “Abrave man, Erus, the son of Arme- Ἴ

nius, by descent a Pamphyliam, who, happening on a time
to die in battle, when the dead were on the tenth day carried
off, already corrupted, was taken up sound3 and being car·
ried home, as he was about to be buried on the twelsth day,
when laid on the funerd pile, revived3 and being revived,
he told what he saw in the other state.” Plato dc Rip. X.

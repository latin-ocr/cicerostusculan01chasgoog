et Naevius, and brackets the rest, and Schitz and Tregder
omit the sentence entirely. Nohbe retains the whole clause,
but punctuates as follows: Liuias f. dedit, (0. 0, 0. s., M.
T, consulibus, a. a. a. Ennium: qui s. m. n. q. Plautus) et
Naevius,· thus making the grammatical constructiones Nae·
vius the same as that of Livia. 1 see no sufficient reason,
however, for changing the reading given hy the MSS. The
separation of qai srom its antecedent Livius is not without
precedente in other passages in Cicero (Billerbeck cites T use.

d. xxxv. 86, ia Verr. Ill. xxxiii, xxxvi, lxxxiii. sq, de
N. D. I. xxiii. 65), nor, granting it to he an inaccuracy in
style, is it at all incredible that Cicero should have been
guilty of some inadvertency in composition. The parenthet-
icol nature of the clause C. Claudio, Ο. s., M. T. c. a. a. a.
Ennium, the whole of which is introduced simply to mark
the tilae when Livius exhibited his first play, makes the irreg-
ular position of qui, as it appears to me, a very natural oue.
Nor is there any difficulty in justifying the allusion of Cicero,
in this place, to the comparative ages of Livius, Naevius, and
Plautus. The three were nearly contemporaries, Livius ex·
hibiting his first play when Plautus was about fourteen years
old, and at least five years before the first drama of Naevius
was enacted. There appears to have been in Cicero’s age
some disputo in regard to ¹the time when the first play ol
Livius was brought forward, and Accius is censured by Cico-
ro, in the passage in Brutus before alluded to, for assigning a
date previous to which plays had been already exhibitcd hy
both Plautus and Naevius. Cicero may have thought it
necessary, then, to mention the fact that Livius was older
than these two dramatists, in order to make clear the point
so essential to his argument, that Livius was the first Roman
who could properly he called a poet.
